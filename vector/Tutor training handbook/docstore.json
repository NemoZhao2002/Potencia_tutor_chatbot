Thank you for being a part of our journey. \n \nThis Tutor Handbook is a resource for you during your time with Potencia. The Handbook\u2019s \ngoal is to give you general information about being a tutor with Potencia, and help you \nnavigate some challenges you might face. Please feel free to skim over the Handbook \nbefore your \ufb01rst lesson and use it for reference afterwards. \nWorking with Potencia is a great opportunity to not only positively impact the livelihood of \nyour learner(s), such as improving their con\ufb01dence or assisting their transition of moving to \nAmerica, it is also an opportunity for you to grow and improve your skills such as \nleadership or cultural understanding.

You are the guide of your classroom  \n1. Enable your learner(s) to speak up and build con\ufb01dence \n2. Focus more on listening and demonstrating, rather than lecturing \n3. Provide immediate feedback for quick recap of learning \n2. How you think about your relationship to your learners matters to how and what they \nlearn from you \n3. Respectfully engage and align your actions with learners\u2019 background, community, \nand culture - \u201cHow can the experience, wisdom, knowledge, and skills of my learner \nfurther our progress toward our goals?\u201d \n4. Successful teaching is an act of leadership in itself. After teaching successfully, we \nhope you develop an unshakable conviction about what is possible through \neducation. We hope this understanding becomes the root of your career choices \nand professional decisions and the driving force behind your bold goals \n5. Here is a brief article on some techniques and mindsets that could be helpful in \npreparing yourself to teach \n \nDe\ufb01ne Success \nWhat does success look like? How do you see yourself successful at the end of the \nsemester? How does your learner de\ufb01ne success? \nRecognize that the learning process is collaborative. Focusing on de\ufb01ning success for both \nyou and your learner can help you create lessons and utilize other resources to help the \nlearner reach their overall goals. \n \nSet Big, Big Goals \n\nAmbitious goal setting is a crucial element of transformative teaching that can motivate \nboth teacher and learner \nGoals can be established during your \ufb01rst meeting, but can be a \ufb02uid process throughout \nyour time together as some goals may be completed and new goals may become a focus \nEnsure your learners realize the \u201cbigger goal\u201d of X; convince that they can reach their big \ngoals if they work hard enough, and that doing so will make a diTerence in their lives \nSet measurable goals with speci\ufb01c timelines and deadlines \nBuild on learners\u2019 desires and motivation: really ask why those learning goals are so \nimportant to them \n \nWorking with Adult Learners and Contextualization \nAdult learning is problem-centered, rather than content-oriented. Outside of the \nclassroom, adult learners are managing life, work, and a family. Inside the classroom, adult \nlearners are more self-directed, have a multitude of experiences to draw from, and \nappreciate contextualization. Contextualization allows learners to understand how the \nlesson applies to their personal, professional, or academic goals. Therefore, it is important \nto be mindful of: \n1. Do topics represent real-life contexts for language use (e.g., civics/current events, \nhealth, \ufb01nancial literacy, workforce preparation)? \n2. Are they tailored to your learner\u2019s current situation (student, workplace, etc)? \n3.

More information on this self-assessment can be found on this page. \n<aside> \ud83d\udca1 \nMuch of the \ufb01rst class will involve getting to know your learner. \nThis is a great time to: \n1. Set initial goals and explore why the learner is taking English classes and what they \nhope to accomplish through continued practice and work \n2. Assess pro\ufb01ciency level in English.

You will be prepared with some context of their \npro\ufb01ciency from the self-assessment results, but you can gauge in real-time where \nthey are across the language spectrum. \n3. Ask open ended questions to get to know your learner, such as:  \n1. Why did you come to Potencia? \n2. What are some things you want to work on? \n3. Where do you use English in your daily life? \n4. Where/why do you want to improve your English? \n4. Discuss your learner\u2019s hobbies, interest, family, jobs, etc, as this material can be \nincorporated into future lessons. </aside> \nAtmosphere \nCreating a welcoming and safe environment is crucial. \nIt is important that learners feel comfortable practicing and responding in English. As many \nlearners have limited experience, creating this enjoyable and safe setting for learning to \noccur is important. \nMeeting Online \nYou can choose a virtual meeting tool you are comfortable with. Most of our learners have \naccess to Zoom or Google Meet. \nLearners may not be fully comfortable with technology and face challenges. \nPlease note the following features: \n\n1. Make sure your learners know how to perform tasks, such as type in the chat \nfeature, enable their microphone etc. \n2. Ensure that learners have a quiet place to work free from distractions. This is \nespecially important in ensuring clear communication \n3. In scheduling sessions, make sure to keep the link consistent: avoid confusion \nbetween \u2018New Meeting\u2019 and using \u2018Personal Meeting ID\u2019 \n4. Utilize screen share, sharing audio or video, and chat features \nLanguage DiSiculty \nSince most of our tutors are not \ufb02uent in the languages they teach, here are some tips to \novercome the language barrier between you and your learner: \n1. If you feel that learners are not able to understand the majority of what you are \nsaying, make sure to check their understanding by asking them to repeat the last \nthing you said \n2. Use Google Translate when necessary; prepare translations in the lessons \n3. People learn best when they are relaxed, feel comfortable in the class, know it\u2019s OK \nto make mistakes \n4. Begin each session with something the learners can do well - short games or \npracticing vocab \n5. Speak slowly & repeat several times \n6.

Warm Up \n\nThis occurs at the beginning of the lesson to establish rapport through small talk and \nreviewing any homework or concepts from prior lessons \n2. Establish Focus for Session \nEstablishing focus only takes a few moments but is very important to redirect focus toward \nand contextualize the current lesson \n3. Present \nThis is the traditional teaching portion of the lesson where you can present new material \nthrough a variety of media \n4. Practice \nAfter presenting the new material, it is important to practice the content with your learner \n(in a collaborative then an independent manner once your learner is con\ufb01dent) \n5. Review and Wrap Up \nAt the end of the lesson, it is important to re\ufb02ect with your learner on if they have any \nquestions and how they feel about that day\u2019s lesson, as this insight can be used to plan \nfuture topics. This is also the best time to assign homework. \n \n \n\nTutoring Session Policy \n\u2022 \nEach learner pays $5 for each tutoring session for commitment to learning. For \nlearners who qualify for scholarships, they are taking the tutoring sessions for free. \n\u2022 \nMost classes are online and 1-on-1. In-person classes are optional based on mutual \nconsensus and should be conducted in a public venue (e.g. your local public \nlibrary). Once matched, the paired group will be placed in a WhatsApp group chat \nfor communication. \n\u2022 \nEach session is one-hour long. \n\u2022 \nPlease make sure to log the tutoring sessions so we could keep track of your impact. \n\u2022 \nOur goal is to make your tutoring experiences as enjoyable and meaningful as \npossible. If you want more learners or switch to a diTerent learner, or have any \nissues and concerns regarding your class, please do not hesitate to reach out to the \nteam. \n\u2022 \nTo ensure that you as a tutor feel supported, there will be monthly check-ins, open \ndrop-in hours, and other events to interact with Potencia community members. \n\u2022 \nOur learners are adults who juggle the demands of both work and family obligations. \nPlease be aware that there can be occasional rescheduling and cancellation of \nclasses. Learners are expected to give tutors an early notice in case of an \nemergency. The team will do its best to facilitate the rescheduling of classes. \n\u2022 \nThe main communication channel of the team is email (team@potenciainc.org). \n \n \n\nSession Re\ufb02ection \nBoth independent re\ufb02ection and re\ufb02ecting with your learner after class is essential to \nimproving your teaching style to better match your learner\u2019s needs. \n\u2022 \nDuring \u201cReview and Wrap Up\u201d \nAlways re\ufb02ect on how the session went with your learner.

You will \ngo through the Potencia tutor training handbook to access tutoring principles and \nresources. \nWEEK 1 \nWEEKS \n2-3 \nMATCHING \nDuring this 2 week period, we will assign you to a learner whose schedule works with yours. \nWe will set up a WhatsApp group with you and your learner \nto coordinate a time and place to meet. This may take longer than 2 weeks in certain \ninstances. \nBEGIN TUTORING \nOnce you and your learner coordinate a time and place to meet, you can begin tutoring. We \ntypically recommend teaching 8-10 classes in one semester, \nhowever this number is \ufb02exible. Potencia tutors usually meet once or twice per week with \ntheir learners. \nWEEK 3 \nWEEKS \n3-10 \nPROGRESS REPORTS \nAfter each class, you will \ufb01ll out a quick form to submit your class record, which track how \nmany classes you taught so far and any feedback/resources you have. \nWORKSHOPS \nWe typically hold tutoring workshops once a quarter, which highlight leadership in the \n\nclassroom. \nWEEKS 3-10 \nWEEK \n10 \nEND OF SEMESTER \nAfter 8-10 classes, the Potencia semester ends.

Initially, the teacher plays a central role in content delivery (\"I \ndo\" phase), but as students acquire knowledge, responsibility shifts to them during \ncollaborative and independent phases (\"We do\" and \"You do\"). This progression \nemphasizes student empowerment and self-reliance in the learning process. \nhttps://lh7-\nrt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfJKPbADMBg5waH3SWQEE_g43nCgbVKurlJL6Zp\n0XKYAdWdMBTo2E54O0MtuIDg23Ep2kPCx_ucGAzJXkG_CrAFVnMSolo-\nBFqfc2kD16fYvTYF_nTOOS_TE1NW2vxkQ5oQsfbgaLhpzwmaVHFd9tHtxwod?key=aSu3d01\nA_UjJt-IyvLiCcw \nResources for Presenting Materials: \u201cI Do It\u201d \n1.

Therefore, you should provide your learner time to self-\ncorrect by pointing them to where the error is or saying what kind of error was made. \n1. Mistakes - If your learner can identify their mistake in this way, they\u2019ve made a \nmistake. Mistakes are an accident or lapse in something that your learner has \nlearned before. \n2. Errors - On the other hand, if your learner can not identify the error, it is \nconsidered an error. An error indicates something that your learner has never \nlearned, something they have mis-learned, or something they may have forgotten. \nThis highlights an area where you can explain in more detail in the same or a \nseparate lesson. \n<aside> \ud83d\udca1 \nCorrection Tips \n1. Modeling:  \n\n1. Repeat the learner's sentence, including the error, and reformulate it \ngrammatically. \n2. Ask, \"Is that what you meant to say?\" to encourage self-correction. \n2. Slightly Delayed Correction:  \n1. Allow learners to complete their thought before correcting. \n2. Promotes self-correction and maintains con\ufb01dence and \ufb02uency. \n3. Clari\ufb01cation Questions:  \n1. Use CCQs and ICQs to elicit self-correction or further explanation. \n2. For example, \"Did you mean to say...?\" or \"Can you clarify what you meant \nby...?\" \n4. Positive Feedback:  \n1. Balance error correction with positive feedback. \n2. Highlight what students did correctly while addressing errors. \n5. Full Stop:  \n1. If repeated errors occur, halt the activity and address misunderstandings. \n2. Consider re-explaining or planning a new lesson to clarify the key point. \n</aside> \n \nAssessing Learner\u2019s Knowledge and Con\ufb01dence \nInformal assessments typically occur within the class through observing your learner\u2019s \ncomfortability and reviewing their homework. \nFormal assessments can include in-class quizzes, listening and speaking activities, and \nreading passages. There will also be a pre and post self-assessment to assess your \nlearner\u2019s English pro\ufb01ciency at the beginning and end of the semester. \nIt is important to employ both formal and informal assessments of your learner\u2019s English \nknowledge and con\ufb01dence.
